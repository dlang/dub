description "A 'monolithic' dynamic library, linking all dependencies statically (except for shared druntime/Phobos) and exporting select symbols explicitly via 'export'"

dependency "inner_dep" path="inner_dep"

# With LDC, `-fvisibility=hidden` is passed down for compiling all dependencies.
dflags "-fvisibility=hidden" platform="ldc"
dflags "-fvisibility=hidden" platform="gdc"
# not supported by DMD

# With LDC on Windows, code ending up in a DLL is compiled with
# `-fvisibility=public -dllimport=all` by default. So we additionally need
# to override `-dllimport` to use the shared druntime/Phobos DLLs (used by
# default for dynamic libraries), which is also passed down to all deps:
dflags "-dllimport=defaultLibsOnly" platform="windows-ldc"
