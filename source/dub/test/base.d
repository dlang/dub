/*******************************************************************************

    Base utilities (types, functions) used in tests

    The main type in this module is `TestDub`. `TestDub` is a class that
    inherits from `Dub` and inject dependencies in it to avoid relying on IO.
    First and foremost, by overriding `makePackageManager` and returning a
    `TestPackageManager` instead, we avoid hitting the local filesystem and
    instead present a view of the "local packages" that is fully in-memory.
    Likewise, by providing a `MockPackageSupplier`, we can imitate the behavior
    of the registry without relying on it.

    Leftover_IO:
    Note that reliance on IO was originally all over the place in the Dub
    codebase. For this reason, **new tests might find themselves doing I/O**.
    When that happens, one should isolate the place which does I/O and refactor
    the code to make dependency injection possible and practical.
    An example of this is any place calling `Package.load`, `readPackageRecipe`,
    or `Package.findPackageFile`.

    Supported_features:
    In order to make writing tests possible and practical, not every features
    where implemented in `TestDub`. Notably, path-based packages are not
    supported at the moment, as they would need a better filesystem abstraction.
    However, it would be desirable to add support for them at some point in the
    future.

    Writing_tests:
    `TestDub` exposes a few extra features to make writing tests easier.
    Ideally, those extra features should be kept to a minimum, as a convenient
    API for writing tests is likely to be a convenient API for library and
    application developers as well.
    It is expected that most tests will be centered about the `Project`,
    also known as the "main package" that is loaded and drives Dub's logic
    when common operations such as `dub build` are performed.
    A minimalistic and documented unittest can be found in this module,
    showing the various features of the test framework.

    Logging:
    Dub writes to stdout / stderr in various places. While it would be desirable
    to do dependency injection on it, the benefits brought by doing so currently
    doesn't justify the amount of work required. If unittests for some reason
    trigger messages being written to stdout/stderr, make sure that the logging
    functions are being used instead of bare `write` / `writeln`.
