name: Testsuite

# Only triggers on pushes to master & stable, as well as PR to master and stable
# Sometimes reverts appear in the upstream repository (e.g. when the revert button
# is clicked by a contributor with commit access), this should be tested as PR).
#
# Also note that Github actions does not retrigger on target branch changes,
# hence the check on push.
