Injection of source files from dependencies

Each (sub)package now supports a source file that will be included in any executable or dynamic library that depends either directly or indirectly of it.

This can be used to register and unregister elements of a package within the dependant package without requiring the dependant to acknoledge that the registration mechanism needs to take place.
