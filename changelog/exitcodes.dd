DUB command exit codes have been made more consistent

Some dub commands have been adjusted to return exit code 2 instead of exit code 1. Exit code 1 is now always used for usage errors, while exit code 2 is the more generic any error occurred or package failed to load.

The following commands are affected:

- dub clean
- dub add
- dub search
- dub convert
