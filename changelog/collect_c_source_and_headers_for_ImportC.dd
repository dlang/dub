Add new properties 'cSourcePaths' and 'cImportPaths' to SDL/JSON

`cSourcePaths` passes the C source files in all specified directories to the compiler.
All C sources found in the given directories for 'cImportPaths' are passed to the D compiler.
This ensures backward compatible behaviour for projects that stored C sources aside of D source file, while porting them to D.

The second keyword 'cImportPaths' will add additional search paths for C headers. These directories are passed to the D compilers
as addition include paths. The feature might need additional tweaking, because the include paths are currently joint with the
D import paths. This might change in future to support independant search paths for C to be passed to the D compilers.
