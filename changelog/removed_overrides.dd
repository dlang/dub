The override system has been removed

The override system was deprecated in v1.30.0 as it was neither
widely used nor generally useful given Dub's available feature set.
With this release, it is now completely removed.

This means that the commands `add-override`, `remove-override`,
`list-override`, and the interaction with `local-overrides.json`
have been removed, along with all the associated APIs.
