Builds dynamicLibrary targets as dynamic libraries instead of static libraries.

Dub will no longer build dynamicLibrary targetType's as staticLibrary.

Except for x86_omf. This has been disabled due to numerous issues that will lead this to not doing what is expected of it.

No compiler or linker flags have been added at this time, you will need to specify the relevant flag to get the compiler to link dynamically against Phobos.
