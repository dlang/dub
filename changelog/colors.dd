The `--color` argument now accepts values `auto`, `never`, `always`

The previous `automatic`, `on`, `off` values are still supported, but
undocumented, because they are used in almost no other program like this. For
consistency, with other Linux tools especially, we have implemented and switched
the defaults to the widely-used `auto`, `never`, `always` values.
